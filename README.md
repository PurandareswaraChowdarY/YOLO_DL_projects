# YOLO_DL_projects
Welcome to my YOLO and Deep Learning Projects repository! This repository contains my hands-on projects focused on computer vision, object detection, and deep learning techniques.

## What You'll Find Here

- Projects demonstrating usage of **YOLOv8** for object detection on custom datasets
- Various **OpenCV** based computer vision projects
- Code for image annotation workflows using tools like **LabelImg**
- Plans to add more deep learning and computer vision projects as I continue to learn and experiment

## Future Plans

Many more projects will be added over time as I explore new techniques, improve my skills, and try out cutting-edge computer vision and deep learning methods.

## Getting Started

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with the notebooks and scripts. If you want to contribute or provide feedback, please open an issue or pull request.

*Happy coding!*
